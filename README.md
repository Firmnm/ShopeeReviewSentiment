# Shopee Review Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer sentiment from Shopee reviews. The pipeline consists of three main components:

1. **Review Scraping** – Extracting customer reviews from Shopee.
2. **Sentiment Analysis & Insights** – Analyzing and visualizing sentiment trends for better business insights.
3. **Sentiment Inference** – Applying machine learning models to determine the sentiment of reviews.

By leveraging natural language processing (NLP), this project helps businesses and researchers understand customer feedback trends and improve decision-making.

## 🛠 Project Structure
The project consists of the following Jupyter Notebook files:

- **`Reviews_Scraping.ipynb`** – Web scrapes customer reviews from Shopee.
- **`ShopeeReviewSentiment.ipynb`** – Analyzes and visualizes sentiment analysis results.
- **`Inference.ipynb`** – Applies sentiment analysis using machine learning models.
